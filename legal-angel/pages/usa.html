                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">The E-3 working visa is a special visa just for Australian citizens who have received a job offer from a US sponsoring company and who are going to the US to work in a speciality occupation. 
                            <br><br>A specialty occupation is an occupation that requires:
                            <br><br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>a theoretical and practical application of a body of specialized knowledge; and</li>
                                <li>the attainment of a bachelor’s or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.</li>
                            </ul>
                            To receive an E-3 visa you must go through the application process, including completing forms, paying a fee and booking and attending an in person interview with a consular officer.
                            <br><br>
                            If you receive an E-3 visa, your spouse and children, even if they are not Australian citizens, will be able to apply for visas to accompany you to the US and to work in the US.
                            <br><br>
                            It is important to note that the E-3 visa has a limit of around 10,500 Australians who can receive the visa each year and that the visa allows Australians to work in the US for 2 years but can be renewed indefinitely.
                            <br><br>
                            If you are a skilled tradesperson, for example with experience in plumbing, electrical and carpentry work, the E-3 visa is not right for you because you normally would not need a bachelor’s degree to perform this work.

                            The ESTA allows Australian citizens to visit the US for tourism, business, transit, medical and short study purposes without a visa for up to 90 days per visit.
                            <br><br>
                            The ESTA can be used for multiple entries to the US and has 2 years of validity or date of passport expiry, whichever is sooner.

                            Alternatively you must be at least 18 years old, establish continuous and lawful residency in the US for 5 years (or 3 years if you are married to a US citizen), apply for naturalisation, take a test and attend a citizenship ceremony and take an oath of allegiance to the US.
