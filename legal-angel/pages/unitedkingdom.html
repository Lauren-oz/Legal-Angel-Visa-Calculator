                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">Australians who are aged 18 – 30 and have enough savings can apply for a Youth Mobility Scheme Visa.
                            <br><br>The Youth Mobility Scheme Visa entitles Aussies to live and work in the UK for up to 2 years.
                            <br><br>Note that Australians who have turned 30 can apply up until their 31st birthday - making it possible to arrive in the UK aged 31 and stay for 2 years. This has been an area of confusion for friends so I want to make this very clear!

                        <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">If you are too old for the Youth Mobility Scheme Visa or would like to stay in the UK after your Youth Mobility Scheme Visa has expired, you can go down the sponsorship route, which will allow you to live and work in the UK for up to 5 years.
                            <br><br>Sponsorship is only available to UK businesses who are licenced sponsors and if your role is for a “shortage occupation”.
                            <br><br>To sponsor you, your UK sponsoring company will need to complete paper work, advertise your role to other people and pay a fee to the UK Government in order to sponsor you. 
                            <br><br>Let’s discuss some of the key risks associate with this visa:
                            <br><br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>If you are on a Youth Mobility Scheme Visa and hoping to stay longer in the UK longer through sponsorship, beware that a UK company may falsely or naively claim they can sponsor you so they get you to work for them and then not actually end up sponsoring you at the end of your visa.</li>
                                <li>It is not uncommon for UK employers to try to get the Australian employee to pay for their own sponsorship. To avoid a nasty surprise, ask your employer if they expect you to pay.</li>
